What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git file is created so that files can be tracked. This is done so that you can track versions of your project/files.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the middle ground between the working directory and the repository.  It is used to hold files/information until the user is ready to make a commit.  This is valuable because it allows the user to specify which files within the directory should be tracked if the user does not need to track all files.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Once you have file/s in the staging area you can run git diff --staged to see what was changed since the last commit. If only one logical change then you can commit it.
